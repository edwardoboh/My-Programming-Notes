1. Ways to declare variables in GoLang:
	~ var i int = 34 ::: Must use this method when declaring package level variables
	~ var g int
		g = 23
	~ f := 23;
2. Formatted printing:
	~ fmt.Printf("%v %T", g, g): v represents value and T represents Type
3. We can define a block of variables at the package level i.e Outside the main function
	var (
		i int = 3
		h float32 = 4.1
		s float64 = 23.3
		name string = "name is apple"
	)
4. Shadowing: In GoLang, a variable can be redeclared more than once but not withing the same scope
	~ We can declare a variable in the Package level and also declare it within a function scope.
5. In GoLang, lowercase first letter package variable name are scoped to the package
6. When we use Uppercase first letter for variable names, the Go compiler exposes it to the outside world
7. To convert between string and number in Go, use the strconv.Itoa([integer to string]) package
8. There are no private scope in Go
