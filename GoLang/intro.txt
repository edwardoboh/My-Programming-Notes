1. Check the Golang documentation for instruction on installing go
2. We'll be using a third party router called mux, which is popullar for goLang development
3. To install it run: go get -u github.com/gorilla/mux
4. Create a project in our Go Path [Go path]/src/github.com/[username]
5. To set our Go Path, run: export GOPATH=$HOME/go
6. Create main.go file. Inside it, use: package main and: import("fmt")
7. create a main function using: func main(){}
8. print out using: fmt.Println()
9. run the program using: go run main.go
10. to build the project, use: go build
11. to run our build, we use: ./[name of the build file]
12. We'll be needing to import the following packages to work build a rest API
	a. encoding/json
	b. log
	c. net/http
	d. math/rand
	e. strconv
	f. github.com/gorilla/mux
13. First thing is to init the mux router using: r := mux.NewRouter()
